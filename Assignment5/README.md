## Assignment Reflection

For my recreated component, I tried to make something similar to the card links that are used on the website Roll20. I edited my existing card component to add a link (it currently links back to my homepage, but in regular use, I'd create a page based on what's in the card and link it there), and added a drop shadow to be more similar to what Roll20 uses. I didn't like the sharp edges on the card images that Roll20 uses, so I kept the rounded edges in my component and also used colors that better suit the color pallet of my current website.
