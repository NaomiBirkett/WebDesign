# Six of Crows

## By Leigh Bardugo

"No mourners, no funerals. Among them, it passed for good luck."

Six of Crows is a fantasy heist story. I love this book for it's complex characters and creative world building. The main "hero", Kaz Brekker, is such a fantastic character because he's morally grey and has such a wonderfully fleshed out back story that slowly unfolds over the course of the book.
