## Assignment Reflection

For updating my website based on peer feedback and ideas from our assignment 1 discussion, I chose to incorporate the suggestion of using a darker color scheme on my site. One of the issues I had in week 1 was that the assignment guidelines specified to make sure black font would show up on the background, which limited the color choices. For this edit, I chose to change some of the font colors to allow darker background colors to better match the themes of the book my website is about.

I also took the peer feedback about adding more spacing between my chapter summaries to fill out the page better, and used it with the ideas generated from reviewing others' sites to improve my page's layout. I added in secion breaks as well to make it look cleaner, and much happier with the overall appearance of my site with these changes.
