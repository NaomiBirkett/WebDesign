# Module 2

## Assignment Reflection

Updating my assignment for module 2 based on peer feedback wasn't super useful since I didn't receive a ton of feedback. I did agree with the one feedback that I did get about removing the outline around my header. I wasn't happy with the header anyway; I had mostly just added some edits while following along with the module readings, so they weren't necessarily conciously added as a design decision. I enjoyed going back in and making it more visually appealing by removing the outline and background box that I wasn't happy with. I also went in and added an icon of a crow to my chapter headings and at the bottom of my "about" and "info" pages to add more visual interest.

I am not enjoying Figma very much. I just don't find it very useful for my workflow; it feels like an extra step. I've also struggled with the fact that I seem to have a slightly different version of the Figma site than what the person in the tutorial videos is using, whether the video just needs updated or if it's something else. For example, the tutorial directs you to the 4 dots icon by text to create styles, but I didn't have the option there. I had to pause the video and go do some research on my own to figure out it's now halfway down the toolbar under "typography". Little things like that just make it harder and more time consuming to work through the module.
