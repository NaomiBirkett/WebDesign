## Assignment Reflection

I like how Flexbox and Grid allow me to align elements on my page in ways that look nice and organized. I think using these tools will make it easier to make my pages look the way I want them to. I really liked how we used Flexbox to create the blog previews, so I think I preferred the Flexbox for this project, but the Grid layout was really impactful for creating an image gallery, so I think which I prefer so far just depends on what I'm trying to do.
